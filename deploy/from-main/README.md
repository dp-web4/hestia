# Deploy from main

One checkout, one timer, one log. The reference daemon on this box is deployed from
`origin/main` every four hours, from a checkout that nothing else touches. The script
header in `hestia-deploy.sh` explains the shape and the rollback; this file is the
install and the operating rules.

## Install (once per box)

    mkdir -p ~/.hestia/deploy
    git clone git@github.com:dp-web4/hestia.git ~/.hestia/deploy/hestia
    git clone git@github.com:dp-web4/web4.git   ~/.hestia/deploy/web4
    install -m 0755 deploy/from-main/hestia-deploy.sh ~/.local/bin/hestia-deploy
    install -m 0644 deploy/from-main/hestia-deploy.{service,timer} ~/.config/systemd/user/
    systemctl --user daemon-reload
    systemctl --user enable --now hestia-deploy.timer

`~/.local/bin/hestia-deploy` keeps itself current from the deploy checkout after that.
The unit files do not: re-run the `install` line for them when they change.

## Operating rules

- Deploy from that checkout, always. Nothing installs `~/.local/bin/hestia` from a
  worktree any more. If you need a branch running on the reference daemon, merge it.
- Local branch work never contends with a deploy build: the deploy tree has its own
  cargo target under `~/.hestia/deploy/target`. The only thing a deploy does that
  anyone else can see is the restart, and only when main moved since the last cycle.
- A test that needs the daemon stable: `echo "why, who" > ~/.hestia/deploy.hold`.
  The next cycle skips and logs the reason. A hold older than 6h is ignored, so a
  forgotten file cannot stop deploys silently. Remove it when done.
- `hestia-deploy --check` says whether the running daemon is current (exit 0) or
  stale (exit 3) without building. `hestia-deploy --build-only` builds without
  installing, for a pre-flight before a hold.
- Every cycle appends one line to `~/.hestia/deploy.log`; a deploy appends
  `DEPLOYED <old> -> <new> (hestia <sha>, web4 <sha>) hooks=<ok|skipped|FAILED>`.
  `journalctl --user -u hestia-deploy` has the same lines plus cargo's tail.
- The members' installer refuses to run from inside a governed session (it is the
  gate installing the gate); it runs under the timer, which is not a member. Test the
  whole cycle with `systemctl --user start hestia-deploy.service`, never by hand.

## What is deployed, and what is not

The daemon binary, then `deploy/install-members.sh` from the same checkout, so the
manifest's `build_id` matches the binary and the dashboard comparison is true by
construction. Set `HESTIA_DEPLOY_HOOKS=0` in the service environment to deploy the
daemon only. The web4 sibling tracks web4 main, which is what CI's `cargo test` builds
hestia against; `web4.pin` is a release property and is not consulted here.
