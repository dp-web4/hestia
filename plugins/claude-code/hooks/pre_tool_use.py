"""Hestia PreToolUse hook for Claude Code — synchronous policy gate.

Wired from .claude-plugin/plugin.json as the PreToolUse hook. Reads the
hook event JSON from stdin, asks the local Hestia daemon for a policy
decision, and exits with the appropriate code to allow / warn / deny
the tool call.

DESIGN
- **Synchronous on Claude Code's critical path.** Unlike the
  PostToolUse witness hook (fire-and-forget), this one MUST block until
  the daemon answers, because Claude Code uses the exit code to decide
  whether to run the tool.
- **Short budget.** Total deadline is `TOTAL_BUDGET_MS` (default 800 ms).
  If the daemon hasn't returned a `decided` verdict by then, we fall
  back to the local heuristic engine (the legacy `web4-governance`
  plugin's pre_tool_use.py).
- **Wait protocol (spec §3.4.1).** If the daemon returns
  `status: "evaluating"` with `nextPollMs: N`, we sleep N ms and
  re-query — up to `MAX_POLLS` times. Useful when (future) LLM-backed
  policy entities need a moment.
- **Action cache.** On a decision we store the action_id under
  /tmp/hestia-actions/<tool_use_id>.json so the PostToolUse hook can
  pair the outcome to the begin_action.
- **Exit semantics for Claude Code:**
    - `exit 0` (silent)               — allow, no message
    - `exit 0` with stderr message    — warn, surfaced to the agent
    - `exit 2` with stderr message    — DENY, Claude Code blocks the tool

ENV
  HESTIA_HOOK_DEBUG=1            log to ~/.hestia-claude/hook.log
  HESTIA_PRE_TOTAL_BUDGET_MS     override TOTAL_BUDGET_MS
  HESTIA_ENDPOINT                override endpoint discovery

FAIL-CLOSED IS NOT A SWITCH (dp, 2026-08-31: "there shouldn't be legacy fallback
period, and fail closed shouldn't be optional"). Any path that cannot get a daemon
verdict — daemon unreachable, budget exhausted, empty or unparseable event,
unexpected error — DENIES. There is no env var that relaxes this and no legacy
engine to fall back to. `HESTIA_PRE_FAIL_CLOSED`, `HESTIA_PRE_NO_FALLBACK` and
`HESTIA_LEGACY_FALLBACK` are gone; a launcher still exporting them is harmless and
has no effect. This closes GATE_BYPASS_CATALOG #2, in which an unreachable endpoint
plus a non-existent fallback path exited 0 with no stderr at all.

# THE GATE IS NOT THE AGENT'S TO EDIT — OR TO READ
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# dp, 2026-07-28: "an agent that wants to do something it doesn't want governed
# can use this to turn off the gate, do whatever, then turn it back on like
# nothing happened. that wouldn't be an accident :)"
#
# Correct, and it is the hole that makes every other control optional. Gate
# integrity (#52) HASHES this file and reports drift on an operator endpoint —
# tamper-EVIDENT, and only to a human who looks. Nothing in the decision path
# consults it, so disable -> act -> restore leaves a clean record and a matching
# hash. The whole governance model rests on a file the governed party can write.
#
# THE PRINCIPLE, which we already use elsewhere: you do not get to modify the
# thing that governs you, for the same reason you do not get to rule on your own
# appeal. Gate custody belongs to a not-self party.
#
# WHY READ IS DENIED TOO, and not only write: reading this file is how you find
# its blind spots. Every false-positive class we hit this week was discoverable
# by reading the matcher. Denying read forces evasion to be blind probing, which
# is noisy, slow and leaves denials on the chain. It converts a silent read into
# an audible attempt.
#
# WHY THIS RUNS BEFORE THE DAEMON CALL AND NEVER CONSULTS IT: if this check
# required a verdict, then "kill the daemon, then edit the gate" would be the
# same evasion one layer over. Self-protection has to hold when everything else
# is down, so it is local, unconditional, and fails CLOSED.
#
# ON THE DELIBERATE JUDGE-BY-MENTION: for Bash this scans the WHOLE command for
# any mention of a self path, which is exactly the matching style that produced
# ten false positives this week and that policy::shell was written to fix. That
# is intentional and the stakes invert here. A false positive costs a rephrase;
# a false negative costs the entire governance model. `sed -i`, `cp`, `>`,
# `python -c`, `tee` and a heredoc all reach this file by different syntax, and
# an executable-position parse would have to be right about all of them.
#
# ONE SCOPED EXCEPTION (2026-08-07, kimi-code, claiming claude-code notice 1529):
# the daemon's destructive preset tells the member, in its reason string, that "a
# quoted heredoc body under cat/tee does not trip it" (presets.rs, backed by
# policy::shell) — but this hook runs FIRST and matched raw, so a report ABOUT the
# gate written by heredoc was refused by code the quoted law does not describe
# (FP8 through the Bash door; the Write door was carved out below when `content`
# left the haystack). `_blank_inert_heredoc_bodies` is that carve-out, here. It is
# deliberately NARROWER than policy::shell: only heredoc bodies are blanked, never
# quoted argument spans, because this gate matches PATHS and a path can sit at
# argument position — `tee "hooks/pre_tool_use.py"` must keep matching, while
# `rm "-rf"` shapes are the destructive preset's problem, not this one's. A
# heredoc body is stdin content: it can never name the destination, so blanking
# it cannot hide a write to the gate — the destination always sits in executable
# position (`> PATH`, `tee PATH`), where matching stays raw. Everything the parser
# cannot read confidently returns None and None means "match the raw command" —
# the fail-closed edge, unchanged.
#
# WHAT THIS IS NOT: containment. A determined agent can still reach the file by
# a path this misses, or kill the hook process. This is A1 — cooperative. What it
# removes is the CHEAP, SILENT version, and it removes "I didn't know" as an
# account, because the refusal names the rule.

# THE GOVERNANCE SURFACE, not just this file. Protecting only `pre_tool_use.py`
# was the first cut, and testing it found the gaps immediately: the SOCIETY gate
# (`society_pre_tool_use.py` — the one that actually parked a member today) and
# `witness.py` (the outcome recorder) were both reachable. Disarming the recorder
# is the worse attack of the two: it does not produce denials, it produces
# SILENCE, and silence is indistinguishable from "attempted nothing".
#
# Matched by filename anywhere, deliberately, so this holds for a peer's copy as
# well as mine. An agent editing ANOTHER member's gate is not a lesser act — it
# is disarming an entity that did not consent, and the record would name the
# victim rather than the author.
#
# `hestia_gate_core.py` added 2026-08-03, on the same reasoning one step ahead of it.
# PR #169 landed the shared policy core — the file that is to BECOME the single gate for
# all five harnesses, with the per-harness hooks reduced to adapter shims. It matched
# nothing here and nothing in `_SELF_MARKERS`, so the whole PR was written unrefused. That
# was verified by writing it, and disclosed in the PR rather than used.
#
# The failure mode consolidation creates: today, disarming the gate means editing five
# files and tripping this rule five times. After the shims land it means editing ONE file
# — and if that file is outside the rule, consolidation will have moved the entire policy
# surface somewhere unguarded while every per-harness protection still reads as intact.
# The rule would be green about five shims that no longer decide anything.
#
# Filename-anywhere is the right mechanism and not merely the convenient one: shims will
# import the core from several locations, so a directory marker would miss it — and the
# rationale directly above ("so this holds for a peer's copy as well as mine") is exactly
# the property needed when one file governs five members.

# (Mirror of policy::shell's INERT_CONTENT_HEADS note; the shadow test below

# --- `git`: the one head that is not a decision by itself ---------------------
#
# Mirror of policy::shell's `git_stdin_is_data` (claude-code, branch
# claude/git-stdin-is-argv-position), which lands adjudication a96b79c4's remedy
# (kimi-code, cross-vendor, UPHELD on deny 9199c25e): the same quoted heredoc
# body was ALLOWED under `cat` and DENIED under `git commit -F -`, because the
# head basename alone decided. The ruling named the remedy — argv-position-aware
# inertness for stdin consumers — and ruled OUT adding `git` to the head
# allowlist: a head-only list cannot tell `git commit -F -` from
# `git -c core.hooksPath=… commit`. This gate's copy exists for the FP8 shape:
# a commit message written by heredoc that names a GOVERNANCE PATH.
#
# The walk vouches for a SHAPE and fails closed at the first thing it does not
# recognise — the head allowlist's discipline, one level finer:
# 1. Every global option before the subcommand must be unable to introduce an
#    interpreter. `-c` is admitted only for _GIT_INERT_CONFIG_KEYS;
#    `--exec-path`, `--config-env` and anything unlisted stop the walk.
# 2. The subcommand must be a builtin whose stdin is content. Git itself refuses
#    to let an alias shadow a builtin, so `commit`/`tag`/`hash-object` cannot be
#    redefined — while clause 1 keeps a NEW alias off the command line (the
#    `git -c alias.x='!sh' x <<'X'` bypass).
# 3. Something must declare stdin to be that content: `-F -`, `--file=-`,
#    `--stdin`. `git commit -m x <<'X'` is not vouched for — unknown means
#    scanned, the same discipline as an unknown head.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT CLAIM: that the repository is safe — a `commit-msg` hook on
# disk can do anything with the message, and a text matcher cannot see the
# filesystem. It says the command TEXT introduces no interpreter for its own
# stdin, the same standard already applied to `cat > f`.

# `git -c KEY=VALUE` keys that cannot change what git will EXECUTE. Deliberately
# two: inline config is the documented way to hand git new code (`core.hooksPath`,
# `core.pager`, `alias.*`, `core.fsmonitor`, `diff.*.textconv`,
# `credential.helper` …), so the default for an unlisted key is "this might
# introduce an interpreter".
# `git` global options taking no value that cannot re-point it at code.
# `git` global options taking a value (`--git-dir=X` or `--git-dir X`) that
# select WHERE git works, never WHAT it runs. `--exec-path` and `--config-env`
# are absent on purpose: both name code or config the command text itself chose.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE GATE'S REGISTRATION IS PART OF THE GATE (2026-07-28, follow-on)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The block above protects the gate's CODE. It was probed against the evasions
# it claims to remove, and the cheapest one walked straight through:
#
#   Write  ~/.claude/settings.json  content='{}'      -> _touches_self: None
#   Bash   mv ~/.claude/settings.json{,.bak}          -> _touches_self: None
#   Edit   ~/.claude/settings.json  (drop the stanza) -> _touches_self: None
#
# Verified by direct call against this file at 99d122f, not by reading it. The
# hook is invoked because `~/.claude/settings.json` names it; that path carries
# no `hooks/` segment and no governance filename, so every marker missed. One
# write of `{}` disarms the PreToolUse gate AND the PostToolUse witness — and
# unlike editing this file it needs no knowledge of what the matcher looks for.
#
# So the protection as shipped was strictly weaker than its own claim to "remove
# the cheap, silent version": the cheapest version was the one it did not see.
# A control that protects its implementation but not its INSTALLATION protects
# nothing — this is `gate installed != gate enforced` pointed at itself.
#
# DECIDABILITY, per tool, because the honest rule differs by what we can see:
#
#   Write / NotebookEdit  we hold the full proposed content. Parse it, compare
#                         the `hooks` stanza to what is on disk, and refuse only
#                         if it would CHANGE. A permissions-only edit passes.
#                         Content we cannot parse is refused: an unreadable
#                         proposal cannot demonstrate it preserves anything.
#   Edit                  we hold old_string/new_string. Refuse if either names
#                         `hooks` or a governance file — that is the only kind of
#                         edit that can reach the stanza.
#   Bash                  undecidable. `mv`, `>`, `jq`, `python -c` and a heredoc
#                         all rewrite the file by different syntax and none of
#                         them has to say `hooks`. Mention of a settings path is
#                         refused outright, same stakes-inversion as above: the
#                         false positive costs one rephrase into Read/Edit, which
#                         ARE decidable, and the false negative costs the gate.
#
# STILL NOT CONTAINMENT, and the gap is now narrower but sharper: settings can
# also be supplied by CLI flag and by env, neither of which passes through any
# hook — by construction, since the hook is not running yet when they are read.
# That surface belongs to whoever installs the agent, not to the agent's gate,
# and saying so is the point: the boundary is where custody changes, and this
# file cannot be both sides of it.
# Governance filenames that are ONLY governed under a `hooks/` path — the deliberate
# weakening, kept small and visible.
#
# These are common enough that matching them anywhere would fire on ordinary work: a repo can
# legitimately hold an unrelated `witness.py`, and `post_tool_use.py` appears in vendor
# examples and documentation. The distinctive names — `hestia_gate_core.py`, the exemption
# ledger — are NOT here, so they are governed wherever they live.
#
# The direction matters more than the contents. A name added to `_GOVERNANCE_FILES` is
# protected by default; weakening it costs a second, deliberate edit into this tuple, and the
# subset test refuses an entry here that is not governed at all. Before, the default ran the
# other way and a governed name silently protected nothing unless someone also happened to put
# it in a hooks directory.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# READ IS ALLOWED AND WITNESSED. WRITE IS REFUSED.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# dp, 2026-07-28, agreeing with kimi's third question: read-denial costs verification,
# not just evasion.
#
# The first cut refused BOTH, arguing that reading the gate is how you find its blind
# spots. kimi's counter is the one I could not answer: denying read also denies the
# byte-identity verification it did for #55 and the source-reading behind three of this
# week's reviews. "A witnessed read is evidence; a refused read is a member who cannot
# check its own governance."
#
# It also contradicted this corpus's own posture. We spent two weeks building PUBLISH THE
# LAW so a member can read what governs it — then I argued a member must not read the
# law's implementation. Those pull opposite ways, and I did not notice while writing it.
#
# So reads pass and are WITNESSED, which keeps the reconnaissance signal (a member reading
# gates repeatedly stays visible) without blinding the member to its own law.
#
# CLASSIFICATION FAILS CLOSED. For structured tools the split is exact. For Bash it is not
# decidable in general — `sed -i`, `cp x gate`, `> gate`, `tee gate` all write and nothing
# in the string reliably says so. Bash is therefore a WRITE unless every segment matches a
# small read-only allowlist AND there is no redirection or pipe. Same reasoning as
# policy::shell's inert-head allowlist: widening requires ADDING a name, a reviewable act;
# forgetting one costs a false refusal, never a hole.
# Heads that are read-only ONLY without their writing flags. Kept separate so the guard is
# impossible to lose by someone appending to the set above.
#   find  — `-delete`, `-exec`, `-fprint*` execute or write
#   sort  — `-o FILE` writes
# Admitted UNDER A GRAMMAR, not bare: `sed` — see `_HEAD_GRAMMARS` below. thor refuted an
# earlier attempt to allow `sed -n` by demonstration, not by argument (`sed -n
# '1r /etc/shadow'` reads a file whose path never appears as an argument, invisible to
# every argument-based check); that case is now enforced by code and pinned by a test row
# instead of adjudicated by this comment.
# NOT added, deliberately, and each for a demonstrated reason:
#   awk    — can write via `print > "file"` INSIDE the program text, where the redirection
#            check below cannot see it. Unlike sed's, awk's command set is a full language;
#            its per-head grammar would be "always refuse", which is no grammar at all.
#   xargs  — runs an arbitrary command.
#   python/node/sh/bash — obviously.
# Ambiguity still means write. The point of this change is to stop calling `2>/dev/null` a
# file write, not to make the classifier clever.


# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Per-head argument grammars (kimi-code, 2026-08-06; notices 1218 -> 1226 -> 1241)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# A private deployment probe measured that this classifier
# was head-only: adding `sed` to `_READ_ONLY_HEADS` admits `sed -i 's/a/b/' <gate>` in both
# spellings and laundered through a `cd` segment — an in-place write indistinguishable, by
# head, from the `sed -n` range-print the addition is for. "Add it to the list" is off the
# table; the remedy is to audit the ARGUMENTS of the heads that need it.
#
# Written HERE rather than in `hestia_gate_core.py` for the same reason `attempted_summary`
# was (:802): the core is not wired yet and the cost is being paid now. claude-code
# measured the sharper version (notice 1241): the core has exactly ONE importer, its own
# unit test, while sitting inside `_GOVERNANCE_FILES` — guarded and unused at once, so a
# grammar landed there is committed, tested, guarded and INERT, with every check green
# about it. When the shims land this belongs on `Verdict` and goes with the rest of the
# duplication.
#
# The grammar is the adjudication above made executable. Everything it cannot parse is a
# write; every write-shaped construct the comment named — `-i` in either spelling or
# bundled, `-f`, `w`/`W`, `s///w`, `s///e`, the GNU `e` command, and the hidden-path
# `r`/`R` — is refused by code. It parses a conservative SUBSET of sed: address forms
# (line, `$`, `/re/` with modifiers, GNU `\c re c`, `+N`/`~N`/`FIRST~STEP`), groups, labels,
# text commands, `s` and `y` with their delimiters, and a closed set of single-letter
# commands. A real sed construct outside that subset costs a false refusal, never a hole —
# the same trade the head allowlist makes, one token stream down.
# Single-letter commands that can neither write a file, read a hidden one, nor execute.
# Heads admitted only through their argument grammar. Checked BEFORE `_READ_ONLY_HEADS`
# in the segment walk, so the audit cannot be lost by someone appending the head to the
# bare set — the `_GUARDED_HEADS` principle, one column over.
# Separators that START A NEW COMMAND, and redirect operators. Enumerated rather than
# regex-matched, because the token stream below yields them as discrete tokens.
#
# `&` IS HERE (codex peer-review finding 4, 2026-08-02). It was not, so
# `ls & <mutating command>` was classified read-only from `ls` alone — a protection hole in
# the deployed gate, not classifier noise. codex withheld the peer factor over it.
#
# `"\n"` was DEAD TEXT from the day it was written until 2026-08-10. shlex counts a newline
# as whitespace and never emits one as a token, so this entry matched nothing and no newline
# ever started a new command — every line after the first arrived as ARGUMENTS to the first
# line's head, and `echo checking\ncp evil.py <gate>` was classified from `echo`. It is live
# now because `_command_lines` splits the TEXT first and the caller inserts one `"\n"` token
# per honoured newline. A membership test that cannot fire looks exactly like one that
# passes; this entry is why the fix below is a tokenizer change and not a set edit.
# INPUT redirects create and modify nothing. Split out 2026-08-05, and the split is the
# narrow, provable half of a larger argument kimi-code and I have been having about the FP6
# remedy — "the redirect branch should return the write target". It cannot, for `<`: there
# is no write target, and `tee <gate> < evil.py` traced to THIS branch (not the head branch,
# as my forum table claimed) would hand a resolver `evil.py` as the thing being written.
#
# What that argument settles here, ahead of the resolver: treating `<` as a write is not
# conservative, it is just wrong, and it costs refusals. `grep foo < <gate>` was refused
# while `cat <gate>` was permitted — the same act, decided by spelling.
#
# `<<` and `<<<` take a DELIMITER or a literal, not a filename, so there is nothing to
# resolve there either. `<&` duplicates a descriptor for reading.
#
# The hole this could open, and why it does not: an input redirect that feeds an
# INTERPRETER (`sh < evil.sh`, `python3 < evil.py`) is still refused — by the head
# allowlist, which is where that danger actually lives, since `sh evil.sh` with no redirect
# at all is the same attack and was never caught by the redirect branch. The test asserts
# the migration rather than the verdict: `shell_reads_a_script` pairs `sh < evil.sh`
# (refused) with `cat < evil.sh` (permitted), and only a live head check makes that pair
# possible. Output redirects (`>`, `>>`, `>|`, `>&`, `&>`) are untouched.
# `branch` and `remote` are NOT here (codex finding 1): `git branch -d` deletes a ref and
# `git remote add` rewrites repository config. A read-looking SUBCOMMAND with a mutating
# FLAG is exactly what a name allowlist cannot see.
# Read-BY-DEFAULT subcommands carrying a mutating flag get the _GUARDED_HEADS treatment one
# column over, rather than a bare-set append (claude-code §5.1, notice 1471, escalation
# 10fb8aa5c095c085): `git hash-object` only hashes, but `git hash-object -w` writes the blob
# into the object database. The flag, not the name, decides. Prefix match, same as there, so
# `-w` bundled or separated is caught alike.
# Control-flow keywords, modelled 2026-08-07 (FP12, kimi-code; found by claude-code's
# isolating pair: `for f in a b; do grep -c def <gate>; done` REFUSED while
# `git show <rev>:<gate> | grep -c ""` ALLOWED — same governance path, same read, the
# only difference the loop). The mechanism: `for`/`do`/`done` are in no head list, so
# the segment walk returned False on the keyword and never reached the body head.
#
# The `cd` precedent does NOT transfer, and this is the load-bearing part. `cd` frees
# its own segment only, because the next segment is head-checked on its own head. `do`
# SHARES its segment with the body: admit `do` as a no-op head and
# `for x in a; do rm -rf /; done` is `[do, rm, -rf, /]`, head `do`, ALLOWED — the `rm`
# is never seen. The safe shape is a STRIP, not an admission: remove leading keywords,
# then head-check what remains. The red arm (`do rm`, `then tee`, `done > f`) is in
# `_SURVIVE`; a green on the false-refusal rows alone would certify the hole.
# Characters after which an unquoted `#` OPENS A COMMENT, plus the start of a line. Bash
# begins a comment only at the start of a WORD: `echo a#b; echo two` prints both lines
# (measured against bash 2026-08-10), because `a#b` is one literal word and the `;` after it
# is a real separator.
#
# DELIBERATELY NARROWER THAN BASH: `<`, `>`, `(` and `)` are word boundaries to bash and are
# NOT in this set. Measured 2026-08-10, and the measurement corrected the reason this comment
# first gave. The first draft claimed `echo hi >#f` redirects into a file literally named
# `#f`, so that treating the `#` as a comment would drop a real write target. That is false:
# bash comments there too, and `echo hi >#f`, `cat <#x`, `echo hi|#w` and `(echo hi)#z` all
# behave as comments (the first three become a syntax error, having lost the operand the
# operator needed). So the honest justification is not fidelity, it is DIRECTION:
#
#   a `#` this set fails to recognise is text that is KEPT, tokenised and head-checked, so
#   the miss can only ADD a refusal — never drop a command from the walk. A `#` recognised
#   too eagerly discards the rest of the line UNCLASSIFIED, which is the bypass shape.
#
# And the omission is measured to cost nothing real: a `#` immediately after a redirection
# operator leaves that operator with no operand, so bash rejects the whole command anyway —
# there is no valid command this set refuses and bash accepts. Widening it to match bash
# exactly means dropping MORE text on the security boundary, which is the dangerous
# direction and wants its own claim and its own review, not a quiet edit here.
#
# NOMAD, working the same claim independently on 2026-08-10, wrote `set(" \t\n;&|()<>")` —
# the faithful spelling. Two parsers, one narrower and one more faithful, neither a bypass.
# Whichever survives, this paragraph is the record that the difference was deliberate and
# measured rather than an oversight in the loser.

    dp, 2026-08-03, after approving several in a row: *"the issue remains that they don't
    tell me what i'm approving or why. they just say 'no reason'."* The dashboard renders
    `why: (none stated — decide on the payload alone)` and then shows no payload.

    They said no reason because nothing ever sent one. The daemon has accepted the operator's
    two questions on the claim path since 2026-08-02 and this hook never populated them — the
    call sent `plugin_id`, `role`, `tool_name`, `marker` and stopped. So an operator saw
    `Edit` and a directory name and was asked to decide, which is identical whether the
    command was `sed -n '470,520p'` or `rm -rf`. A live channel with nothing in it.

    **THE WIRE ARGUMENTS ARE `reason` AND `detail`.** Not `stated_reason` / `stated_detail` —
    those are only how the daemon STORES and re-emits them, in the `gate_escalation_opened`
    chain entry and in `hestia_gate_pending_escalations`. An earlier draft of this docstring
    named the stored pair, and codex caught it before it could mislead anyone (NOT-SAME review
    of #175). The consequence would have been silent and permanent: hestia tools are
    `additionalProperties: true`, so sending two keys nobody reads SUCCEEDS, the escalation is
    filed, and the operator surface renders "why: (none stated)" forever — the exact bug this
    function exists to fix, reintroduced by the comment describing the fix.

    kimi's and codex's gates already send an attempted summary — it is why kimi's denials
    render with the full command and this member's do not. **This is the drift the shared
    core exists to end, and it drifted in the direction that costs the operator.** Written
    here rather than only in `hestia_gate_core.py` because the core is not wired yet and
    the cost is being paid now; when the shims land it belongs on `Verdict` and this copy
    should go with the rest of the duplication.

    BOUNDED AND SELF-CENSORING. Truncated hard, because an escalation body is read by a
    human under interruption. Redacted on credential-shaped tokens, because a refusal is not
    a licence to copy a payload into the witness chain: an egress deny is ABOUT a secret
    path, so verbatim echo would reproduce the protected thing inside a record that is
    deliberately easier to read than the file was.

    This message used to assert "The policy daemon is unavailable" on every

                saturating the box). Correct response: back off and retry.
      refused   nothing is listening. Correct response: stop and escalate.

    Measured on 2026-07-28: a peer was parked for 4+ minutes, escalating to the
    operator on this message's instruction, while the daemon had been up
    continuously for eight hours (`NRestarts=0`) under a 15-minute load average
    of 7.39 caused by another member's test runs. The member did exactly what it
    was told; the message was wrong. codex's gate has carried a comment
    describing this same confusion — "no policy verdict (daemon path failed)
    while the daemon was up the whole time" — and nothing acted on it.
